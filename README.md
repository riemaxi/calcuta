# Project calcuta

This is the world's largest calculus engine

Every node (dust) is identified by the name of the function it implements, the domain area of expertise, 
the input, and output arguments.

A calculation is recursely defined as:

- dust
- dust | calculation

A star is a hub where dust can be published so calculation users (molders) can use it
in order to create calculations

Stars can be clustered by domains of expertise and other criteria

A dust can be implemented by any device with an ip address

Here is an example of a dust:

name: math/algebra/string/sum/x_y.z
host: http://46.30.213.202

usage
 host/math/algebra/string/sum/world

with response: 
1\nhello\nworld

or standard http 5xx error:

0\n5xx
